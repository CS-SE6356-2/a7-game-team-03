WELCOME TO UNO | RULES
	At the start of a game, each player is dealt 7 cards, and the top
	card on the draw pile is placed on the discard pile. If that card
	is an Action Card, that Action is applied to the first player's turn,
	unless that Action Card is a Wild Draw 4 Card. In that case, the card
	is put back into the deck, and it is reshuffled, and a new card is put
	on the discard. This is how the deck works any time it needs to be 
	reshuffled.
	
	When it is a player's turn, they must play a card if they have a "match".
	This means that either the value or color of their card matches that of
	the card on top of the discard. This includes Action Cards as well. If
	the top of the discard is a Red Reverse Card, then a Blue Reverse Card
	can be played on top of it.
	If a player has no matches, then they must draw a card.
	
	Once a player has managed to play all of their cards, they win.

STARTING THE GAME
	In order to play, a server has to be running. The server will report
	on the command line what the socket it's listening on is. Then client
	programs need to be run, and a name and host socket have to be entered.
	Once that has been done, the player can connect to the host.
	
	The first player that connects is the "leader", and is the one that
	decides when the game starts.
	
PLAYING THE GAME
	Once all the players have connected and the leader has started the game,
	each player will get their cards,
