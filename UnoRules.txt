Initialization:
7 cards are provided to all of 2-10 players. The rest of the deck is
placed into a Draw pile, and the top card of the Draw pile is placed
into a Discard pile.

GamePlay:
First player is normally left of the dealer. Gameplay goes in a clockwise
direction. Every player attempts to match their cards to the top card
of the Discard pile.
Match:
	A match is made either by number, color, or symbol/Action.
	If the top Discard card has a red 8, you can play a red card 
	of any number, an 8 of any color, or a Wild card(which can alter
	the color in play).
If the player has no matches, or chooses not to play despite having a 
match, they must draw from the Draw pile. If that card can be played,
it must be played. Otherwise, the next player begins their turn.
	A player can also play a Wild or Wild Draw Four card on their turn.
NOTE:
	If the first card on the Discard pile from game setup is an Action
	card, the action is applied to the first player's turn, unless it is
	a Wild or Wild Draw Four card. If it is a Wild card, the first player
	can decide the color. If it is a Wild Draw Four card, put it back in the
	Draw pile, reshuffle, and try the top card.
	
When drawing new cards, there are two ways to go about it. There is the
method described above, but drawing can also be done such that a player
draws cards until they have a match, at which point they play that match.

When the Draw pile is exhausted, the Discard pile is shuffled, and a new
Draw pile and Discard pile are made from it in the usual manner.

Once a player has one card left, the must yell "Uno". If another player 
calls them out on not having said "Uno" before the next players turn,
then the player with one card left has to draw two more.
"Uno" must be called anytime that a player is left with only one card.
Even if they had one card, couldn't play it and so had to draw, but then
could play the new card. They would have called "Uno" when they were first
left with one card, and again when they were left with one card for the second
time.

The player that gets rid of all of their cards first wins.

ACTION CARDS:
These are cards that require some action to be performed.
Reverse:
	Reverses play order.
Skip:
	Skips the next player in the play order.
Draw Two:
	The next player will draw two cards and skip their turn.
Wild:
	Represents all four colors, and can be played on any card.
	The player has to state what the new color is.
Wild Draw Four:
	Same as Wild, but the next player also draws four cards and
	skips their turn. This card is supposed to only be played
	when you have no other possible matches available. If you
	play it, the next player can challenge you, and see your hand.
	If you played it illegally, you draw four cards. If not, the
	other player draws six cards.
