MAKING A LIST OF CARDS
There are two ways that cards can be generated by a cardList file. The main way is by reading
in a line of the form: value category
The program will simply take the value and category and make a card with those attributes.
The other way is to create a combinatorial block like this:
c
....
....
cvals
....
....
ccats

the initial c signals to the program that it is entering a combinatorial block, and every line forward will
be a single value. When the string "cvals" is read, the program starts reading in categories. "ccats" ends the
block, and the program will create cards in every combination of value and category.
There can be multiple combinatorial blocks in the file, and they can be followed by single card pairs as well.
